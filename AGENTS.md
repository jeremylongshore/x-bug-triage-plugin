## Beads (bd) Issue Tracking

This project uses [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for AI-friendly task tracking.
Tasks are stored in `.beads/` and tracked via the `bd` CLI.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                              # Find available work
bd show <id>                          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress   # Claim work
bd close <id> -r "Evidence"           # Complete work (or: bd done)
bd note <id> "Progress update"        # Append a note
bd prime                              # LLM-optimized context
bd doctor                             # Health check
```

## Core Workflow

### Session Start
1. Run `/beads` or `bd prime` to recover context
2. Run `bd ready` to see available tasks
3. Pick a task and claim it: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`

### During Work
- Keep notes: `bd note <id> "what I did"`
- Create subtasks: `bd create "Subtask" --parent <id> -p 2`
- Check blockers: `bd blocked`

### Session End (Landing the Plane)
1. Close finished tasks: `bd close <id> -r "Evidence of completion"`
2. Update in-progress tasks with status notes
3. Run quality gates (tests, linters, builds)
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** (mandatory):
   ```bash
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. Hand off context for next session

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Label | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| P0 | Critical | Blocks everything, fix immediately |
| P1 | High | Important, address this session |
| P2 | Normal | Standard priority |
| P3 | Low | Nice-to-have, address when convenient |

## Critical Rules

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing — leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" — YOU must push
- Always close beads when work is done
- Always start sessions with `bd prime` or `/beads`

## Creating Tasks

```bash
# Simple task
bd create "Implement user auth" -t task -p 1 -d "Add JWT-based authentication"

# Bug report
bd create "Login fails on mobile" -t bug -p 0 -d "Steps to reproduce..."

# Feature request
bd create "Add export to CSV" -t feature -p 2

# With dependencies
bd create "Write tests" --parent <epic-id> -p 2
```

## Advanced Commands

```bash
bd list --status in_progress    # What am I working on?
bd statuses                     # List valid statuses
bd search "auth"                # Search by text
bd stale                        # Find stale issues
bd dep add <child> <parent>     # Add dependency
bd graph <id>                   # View dependency graph
```
